# odin-recipes
This is te first project on the odin project foundations course. This is a readme file from the repo of this project. It doesnt contain much. Its just a bunch of random words. Wouldn't really call it a rambling. Just some words that don't make any sense. But well whatever. I'm just bored and thought that modifying this file was a good idea to practice modifying a file. I mean that's how it is done, right?

Anyways, what's the deal with these lampshades, amirite guys? Do you want the light from the lamp or the shade? Also what's the point of mini cupcakes? You're making a mini version of a cupcale, which is already a mini version of cake?!Seriously, where does it end with you guys?
