    <h2>Description</h2>

These homemade dumplings are easy to make with just six pantry staples â€“ and they're even easier to eat. With this top-rated recipe, you'll make perfect dumplings every time. </p>
    <p>A dumpling is a small mass of dough that can be boiled, fried, baked, or steamed. There are a ton of dumpling varieties out there, from pork- and cabbage-filled Chinese dumplings to cheesy Polish dumplings. </p>
    <p>They're prepared by dropping spoonfuls of dough into a pot of boiling soup or stew. The starch in the dumplings thickens the broth, resulting in a rich stew that's impossible to resist.</p>
